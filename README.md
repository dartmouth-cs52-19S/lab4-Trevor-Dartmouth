# README.md for Lab4
## What I Did
* I made a meme page for all the students of CS 52 to share their ideas
* On the front page, they can view all the memes that people have made
* With the Add New Post button they can add their own memes to the front page
* With The View Post Button they can see all the details of the meme and possibly edit the meme for the better.
* For part 2 The user can now make an account and sign in later
* Creating/Updating/Deleting a post is now protected to users only
### What Worked
* I thought that Redux was fairly easy to understand and connecting it to react was also pretty easy
* I enjoyed using Material UI as a basis for my UI. This was a very easy to make my UI look really nice. (Though it still took a long time)
* Making the Authentication reducers were not that bad to implement
* Making a sign in/up page was pretty easy as well
### What Didn't Work
* I thought working with the API was very difficult and I ran into a bunch of small errors simply because I didn't know how the backend worked
* Trying to connect the author to the post took a lot longer than I expected and I believe I did it in a round about way, but hey it works now.

## Grading Notes
* No extra credit was attempted
* Please Ignore the no Image or Src Tag for Material UI warning. I have put an image tag in the CardMedia Section and it works exactly like the home pages' so I assume it is something wrong with Material UI.
* I was working with John Sullivan during this lab so we should have similar appraoches/lines of code in some areas. I believe I marked all the areas but I want to make this known in case I missed a part.
